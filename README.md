# Firefly-ringdown

--------------------------------------------------------------------

`Firefly-ringdown` is a Python program for accelerating the Bayesian analysis of ringdown signals involving multiple quasi-normal modes (QNMs), serving the ringdown signal analysis of future gravitational-wave detectors.

It implements the marginalization of the amplitude parameters under a freely chosen QNM amplitude prior, dramatically reducing computation time while maintaining high sampling quality.

### üõ†Ô∏è Development install

We recommend using conda to configure the environment; please run the following command in the terminal.

```sh
conda create -n firefly python=3.10.16
conda activate firefly
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üöÄ Quick start

Make sure that `firefly` is in your current operating path, run the following command in the terminal,

```sh
python -m firefly.cli.firefly_ringdown --config_path config/NR0305_221_firefly_config.yaml
```

For comparison with full-parameters estimation, run the following command in the terminal,

```sh
python -m firefly.cli.fullparams_ringdown --config_path config/NR0305_221_fullparams_config.yaml
```

We offer a script to compare posteriors of Firefly and full-parameter sampling, 
```sh
python -m firefly.cli.posterior_comparison --config_path config/posterior_comparison.yaml
```

### üí° Algorithm

Based on the likelihood-driven importance-sampling scheme design, we extended the marginalization acceleration approach of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic to arbitrary prior scenarios, significantly accelerating the computational efficiency of traditional full-parameter Bayesian inference.
